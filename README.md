# OpenAI Cookbook
Examples and guides for using the OpenAI API, brought to you by [Artem Tyrell](https://artemtyrell.com).

The OpenAI Cookbook shares example code for accomplishing common tasks with the OpenAI API. There is also a main [Open AI Cookbook](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook) provided by OpenAI themselves (which inspired ours).

To run these examples, you'll need an OpenAI account and associated API key ([create a free account](https://beta.openai.com/signup)).

Most code examples are written in Python, though the concepts can be applied in any language.
